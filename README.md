# Memory Game Project

A classic memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - download the files and open `index.html` in google chrome.

## How to play

Click on the cards to flip them over, there are 2 of each symbol on the board. Match them all with less moves for a better â˜… rating.

### Dependencies

I am using font awesome to power the symbols on the cards - check them out here https://fontawesome.com
